**** Unsupervised Learning
     - clustering
     - dimensionality reduction
** What is machine learning?
*** Decision Tree
Split on most influential factor, then successively on less influential.
*** Naive Bayes (e.g. spam detector)
*** Logistic regression
Error function is log loss probability. The class boundary is a line.
*** Support vector machines
Consider points closest to the class boundary. We want the boundary to be as 
far away from all points as possible.
*** Neural networks
A single line may not be a good boundary between classes. We can then use two
lines.
*** Kernel method
Sometimes a set of lines isn't enough to form a good class boundary. Then we 
can use kernel methods.
*** K-means clustering
We must know the number of clusters.
*** Hierarchical clustering
We don't know how many clusters, but we know a good distance criteria for 
splitting points into clusters.

Things to learn by doing this project are
  - How to explore data and observe features.
  - How to train and test models.
  - How to identify potential problems, such as errors due to bias or variance.
  - How to apply techniques to improve the model, such as cross-validation and grid search.
