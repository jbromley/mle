    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Hint:** This problem can phrased using examples like below.  \n",
    "* Would you expect a home that has an `'RM'` value(number of rooms) of 6 be worth more or less than a home that has an `'RM'` value of 7?\n",
    "* Would you expect a neighborhood that has an `'LSTAT'` value(percent of lower class workers) of 15 have home prices be worth more or less than a neighborhood that has an `'LSTAT'` value of 20?\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "As the value of `'RM'` (average number of rooms in the neighborhood) increased, I would expect that the value of `'MEDV'` would also increase. This is because more rooms in a house implies a larger house and therefore more square footage, which in turn translates to a higher price. More rooms also generally implies more bedrooms, and house costs generally scale with the number of bedrooms in the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of `'LSTAT'` increasing means that a greater percentage of the homeowners in the area are \"lower class\" or working poor. A neighborhood having large proportions of working poor will necessarily have to have lower cost housing so that the working poor can purchase them. Therefore, I expect that as the value of `'LSTAT'` *increases*, the value of `'MEDV'` will *decrease*. Concretely, a neigborhood with an `'LSTAT'` value of 90 must have a lot of inexpensive housing so that the prices and neighborhood qualities are attractive to the working poor. A neighborhood with an `'LSTAT'` value of 5 must have expensive housing that is inaccessible to the working poor due to cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the value of `'PTRATIO'` decreases, I would expect that the value of `'MEDV'` increases. This is because a low value of `'PTRATIO'` implies that the public school district is well funded and can afford to have more teachers and so a lower `'PTRATIO'` value. It may also mean that an area has a high number of private schools, which can afford to hire more teachers. Since in the US, public education is largely funded by property taxes and private schools are often not accessible to the lower class, the lower `'PTRATIO'` value would imply that property (and housing) is more expensive and that there are a lot of people capable of paying for private school and therefore able to afford more expensive housing."

Next we need to find out how much of the variance is explained by the model. Intuitively, the data points will lie near the model line if the model does a good job of explaining the variance (we will see how this affects the $R^2$ score below). In other words, the residuals are small. Concretely, we measure the error of the model as the sum of the squares of the residuals: $$SS_{res} = \\sum_i (y_i - f_i)^2$$ where $f_i$ is the value the model predicts for a given x. Now that we know how much variance is unaccounted for by the model we can compute the $R^2$ as $$R^2 = 1 - \\frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}}$$ Therefore we can see, a good model will have all of the data points lying near the model line so as to reduce the square of the sum of the residuals to close to zero such that $R^2$ has a high value.\n"

By underfitting, we mean that the model is too simple to explain variance in the data and so will perform poorly on the testing set. By overfitting, we mean that the model is overly complex and explicitly maps the data set to the correct answer. In this case, the learned model will not generalize well and so perform poorly on the testing set (since it has never seen the testing data before and so can't \"memorize\" it).\n",

Similarly, if we train on nearly all of the data and only have a small testing set, we will not be able to tell if the model generalizes well and again we will be overfitting. If the proportion of training data is too low, we will likely end up underfitting, as a small training set may not have enough variance to train the model adequately."

However, past 300 points one sees that the training score has a slight upward trend while the testing score has a slight downward trend. Seeing as the training and testing scores have converged to a narrow range at 300 training points, it is unlikely that adding more training points would benefit the performance of this model.

When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10 the model suffers from high variance. The high training score and low validation score are indicative of an overfitting situation.

    "**Answer:** The grid search technique is a method of finding the ideal hyperparameters for a model. To do a grid search, we take each hyperparameter and sample a set of values for each hyperparameter. We then take the Cartesian product of all the hyperparameter sets and train a model for each combination of values. The totality of hyperparameter combinations gives us a \"grid\". The grid will have as many dimensions as there are hyperparameters. After training a model for each point in the grid, we use the cross-validation scores to determine which hyperparameters give us the best model.\n",

The advantage of this is that we do not lose data that will be used for cross-validation, which is especially important for small data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the k-fold cross-validation technique, the data is first divided into the training and testing sets as usual. The k-fold cross-validation training technique then takes tha training data set and divides it into `k` smaller sets called folds. Then for each of the `k` folds, we do the following. First, the model is trained with `k - 1` folds as training data. Next, the unused fold is used to compute a performance metric for the model on that fold. To compute the performance metric for the model, we average the metrics from each of the `k` folds. \n",

    "The benefit of using k-fold cross validation with grid search is that it allows us to ensure that the model that performs best in the grid search generalizes well in addition to predicts well. Without k-fold cross validation, if we do a grid search using only a training and testing set and pick the best model, we may select a model that has some type of bias and does not generalize well. Running k-fold cross validation on each point of the grid eliminates this possibility."

In Boston since 2000, housing prices have increased by 11.2% (source: trulia.com) year-over-year, greatly outpacing inflation. Therefore, the prices used to train this model do not reflect the realities of the housing market. \n",

    "The model is not terribly robust. The sensitivity check showed that for client 2, the predicted price varied by as much as $73,357.39. Given that this is a significant percentage of the predicted prices, using this model could result in either greatly underpricing a house and losing potential profit or overpricing a house and not being able to sell it.\n",

    "The data collected in Boston would not be applicable to a more rural city. First, rural houses tend to be much lower than urban prices due to the lower population densities.
